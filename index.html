        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am seeking a career change, I am attending a bootcamp with EdX Skills
         for life and am loving the challenges it is giving me, I love to code 
         and solving problems.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been learning CSS Grid, basic structures of websites and how
           to link CSS to HTML pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently a MOT Tester, vehicle Technician and Diagnostic trechnician which
           has prepared me for a more 3d view of tasks. I use this ability in making 
           websites, planning in my head how the structure will look and then 
           implementing it in code. 
        </p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          For the last 7 years I have been a car mechanic, MOT tester and diagnostic technician.
          This has been great training in knowing how car parts come apart and go back together, almost like a 3d puzzle,
          while doing this work is rewarding I believe it is now time for me to make a career that will lead me for 
          many years to come in the future of the world and becomming a coder. 
        </p>
        <p>I have experience in Customer service while working on London Underground, I was there
          for 5 years and worked front-line facing customers and also in the ticket office 
          where I was involved in the start up of Oyster cards.
